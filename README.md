# Eyedrivomatic
Eyedrivomatic is a low cost system to enable quadraplegics to drive an electric wheelchair using only their eyes. In this repository are all the files needed to build an eyedrivomatic system yourself. An eyedrivomatic system is made up of two parts; a 'brain box', and an 'electronic hand'. The electronic hand physicaly pushes the wheelchair's joystick, and the brain box controls it. Software on the users computer, controlled by eyegaze equipment, sends commands to the brain box.
